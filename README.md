## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Submission folder for the project of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. 

### Dataset
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones  

### Files
* CodeBook.md contains detailed explanation regarding the processing steps.  
* run_analysis.R is the R script that processes the data in the required 5 steps.  
* grouped_tidy_dataset.txt is the final data set exported as .txt file.  
* Data is not in this folder to keep a clean environment and avoiding to unnecessarily occupy space. The run_analysis.R file takes care of downloading all necessary files and then removing them once all processing steps are executed.
